PROS
- easy to start with Vue CLI `$ vue create example-app`
- Awesome CLI UI `$ vue ui`
- nice devtools (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)
- embraces classic web technologies (for some developers templates fell more natural to read and write)
- can use pre-processors such as Pug for templates
- css scoped property out of the box
- data is observable!

CONS
- need to include components that you want to use in a component
- rebinding of this
- template interpolation?!! for example: img src, div inline style
- mixin conflicting keys - can't use namespace :(
- Need to create a bridge between logic and template
